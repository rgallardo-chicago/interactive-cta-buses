# CTA Ridership Trends 2001 to 2024

Ruben Gallardo

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
My goal is to create an interactive map that shows CTA ridership trends over the years. In my initial proposal, I wanted to make it a comparison between present ridership and pre-pandemic levels. However, since my data goes back to 2001, I noticed that ridership varies over years for many lines. For example, some bus routes had more ridership in the early 2000's compared to the late 2010's. Based on this discovery, my goal has slightly changed since now I don't want to solely focus on comparing the present day to 2019.


## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
No, I am not facing any challenges. My initial dataset only had ~1 million rows, which I condensed to ~38.6k rows in the `/data/CTA_Bus_Ridership_Monthly.csv` file. 

I'm planning on also adding L-train data, so I'm hoping that I don't run into challenges of having too much data that it crashes the app. 


## Walk us through an interaction, either in words or you can record a quick 2-3 minute video.
Users have the ability to choose a Year-Month from the dropdown menu and the color of the bus routes change based on whether the ridership during that month is above, below or the same as the 12-month moving average. Users can also click on a bus route and see the monthly ridership and the moving average of that route graphed. Finally, users can click the play button to see the ridership trends for each month from Jan 2001 to September 2024.
